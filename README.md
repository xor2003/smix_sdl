(v1.30) SMIX - Sound Library (for SDL) Digital sound engine that plays multiple sounds simultaneously, mixing them in real time.
Supports resource files, 16-bit output.
Uses small fraction of CPU time.  For SDL (other DOS ports see in web).
So you easier port DOS sound apps. If it works on SMIX on DOS it could be ported to SMIX SDL.
